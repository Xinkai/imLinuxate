imLinuxate helps port software to Linux indirectly. imLinuxate helps improve Linux drivers
indirectly.

The idea is explained here.

Say, John loves Ubuntu and Ubuntu is great for him. He does everything under Ubuntu except
occasionally doing image editing using Photoshop under Windows. He wishes that one day he can use
Photoshop under Ubuntu.

Every time John uses Windows, there is a slight Ubuntu market share drop. John then installed
imLinuxate. imLinuxate tells the world "This computer is Ubuntu" while in fact it's Windows.

Many Linux users, like me, like John are dual-booters. imLinuxate makes the Linux market share not
drop when we use other operating systems.

Ideally if enough people use imLinuxate, there could be a boost in desktop Linux market share than
that of today. As a result, software/hardware vendors will take Linux more seriously, and produce
Linux-friendly products.

Back to John story. Maybe one year from now, Adobe releases Photoshop for Linux after seeing the
Linux usage increases. John can finally use Photoshop under Ubuntu.

Spread this software. imLinuxate is useless unless it is used by millions.
